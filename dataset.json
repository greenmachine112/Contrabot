AWS continues to offer other services based on Nvidia's Hopper chips, its flagship model for training AI systems, the spokesman said.\nThe Project Ceiba transition was announced by the two firms, opens new tab in March when Nvidia unveiled the new Blackwell chips.\n\"To be clear, AWS did not halt any orders from Nvidia. In our close collaboration with Nvidia, we jointly decided to move Project Ceiba from Hopper to Blackwell GPUs, which offer a leap forward in performance,\" an AWS spokesman said in statement.\nThe Financial Times amended its earlier story to say that Amazon's chip orders had not yet been placed. The newspaper directed a request for comment to its updated story.",

Their moat is much larger than Apple\u2019s and the questions you\u2019re asking are really the wrong ones.\n\nNVDA is focused on chip design and building out a whole GPU based platform.  NVDA outsources the manufacturing which is why you see TSM and ASML move in sync mostly.  Competitors using their platform would be amazing as it would solidify their moat as THE platform which would help them collect additional IP royalties potentially and would ensure their platform is the one companies go for (and need enterprise support for).\n\nThe big data centers will need to churn these cards between 18-36 months depending on how heavy loads are maintained and how well they want to maintain the cards.  Right now the big data centers are wiping out direct to enterprise by volume creating a vicious cycle.  A company can\u2019t quickly direct order GPUs and build their own racks so they go to the big public CSPs for on demand capacity, which then leads to the CSPs buying more and keeping it further way from direct enterprise.  There are still times when you\u2019ll run into on demand capacity issues in CSPs given all the compute is in use - it\u2019s kind of wild a cloud provider can actually not have demand.\n\nThe real questions are:\n\nDoes TSM and ASML have any real capacity to support a competitor? (They currently really don\u2019t)\n\nDo the CSPs see any slowing for GPU based resources? (They aren\u2019t)\n\nWhen is the growth cycle predicted to slow and get into a maintenance cycle? (This is really the TBD everyone is trying to suss out)\n\nThere\u2019s going to be a fine line between too much capacity and too little capacity.

I am assuming the post I replied to meant they were using Nvidia gpus to run AI models to help him produce new chips. Nvidia chips aren't that much use when it comes to highly branching workloads, which you would require when testing logical output on chip designs. Long decision free instruction pipelines, for sure. Anything that requires the path of execution to make lots of logical decisions and branch often, they are terrible at.  Thats why they are so fast at specific workloads like graphics rendering or matrix multiplications.",
