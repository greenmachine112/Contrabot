Project Description: Inverse Sentiment Trading Bot

Overview
The Inverse Sentiment Trading Bot is an automated trading system designed to analyze stock sentiment from the subreddit r/wallstreetbets and place trades inversely based on this sentiment. The bot aims to capitalize on the contrarian approach by trading against the prevailing sentiment expressed in the subreddit’s comments and posts. It will be capable of dynamically managing the list of monitored stock tickers, executing trades with predefined risk management strategies, and handling administrative commands.

Key Features
1. Data Collection with Reddit API
Sub-problems and Validation:
Register for Reddit API credentials:

Task: Create a Reddit account and apply for API access on Reddit’s developer portal.
Validation: Ensure API keys are received and functional by testing a basic API request.
Set up Reddit API with praw:

Task: Install praw library and configure API credentials in the bot.
Validation: Write and run a test script to fetch subreddit information to confirm the API setup.
Fetch comments and posts from r/wallstreetbets:

Task: Write code to access the subreddit and fetch a specified number of recent comments and posts.
Validation: Log the fetched data to ensure comments are correctly retrieved.
Filter comments to identify stock tickers:

Task: Implement regex or other parsing techniques to extract ticker symbols from comments.
Validation: Test regex against sample comments to ensure accurate extraction of ticker symbols.
2. Sentiment Analysis with VADER
Sub-problems and Validation:
Install and set up VADER sentiment analysis tool:

Task: Install vaderSentiment library and initialize the VADER sentiment analyzer.
Validation: Run a test script to analyze sample text and verify sentiment scores.
Preprocess comments:

Task: Clean text by removing special characters, URLs, and stop words; tokenize text into words.
Validation: Print preprocessed comments to verify that text cleaning and tokenization are performed correctly.
Classify sentiment of comments:

Task: Use VADER to analyze the sentiment of preprocessed comments and define thresholds for classification.
Validation: Compare sentiment classification against known examples to ensure accuracy.
3. Trade Execution with Alpaca API
Sub-problems and Validation:
Register for Alpaca API credentials:

Task: Create an account on Alpaca and obtain API keys for accessing Alpaca’s services.
Validation: Verify API keys by making a basic API call to fetch account information.
Set up Alpaca API with alpaca_trade_api:

Task: Install alpaca_trade_api library and configure API credentials in the bot.
Validation: Write and run a test script to place a mock trade in the paper trading environment.
Implement trade execution functions:

Task: Write functions to place buy and sell orders, including parameters for order type, quantity, and time-in-force.
Validation: Test trade execution functions with mock trades and log results to ensure correct behavior.
4. Ticker Management
Sub-problems and Validation:
Implement functions to add tickers:

Task: Create a function to add new tickers to the list, validate ticker format, and check for duplicates.
Validation: Test adding valid and invalid tickers to ensure proper validation and updating of the list.
Implement functions to remove tickers:

Task: Create a function to remove tickers from the list and ensure the ticker exists before removal.
Validation: Test removing existing and non-existing tickers to ensure correct functionality.
Provide an admin interface for ticker management:

Task: Develop a command-line interface (CLI) or web interface for managing tickers and implement command parsing and execution.
Validation: Test the interface by adding and removing tickers through commands to ensure accurate updates.
5. Risk Management
Sub-problems and Validation:
Define stop loss and take profit thresholds:

Task: Determine appropriate stop loss and take profit levels, allowing for configurable thresholds.
Validation: Validate threshold values through backtesting to ensure they align with risk management goals.
Integrate risk management into trade execution:

Task: Modify trade execution functions to include stop loss and take profit orders.
Validation: Test trades with stop loss and take profit orders in the paper trading environment to verify functionality.
6. Persistent Storage
Sub-problems and Validation:
Choose a storage format (e.g., JSON, database):

Task: Decide on using a JSON file or a database for storing tickers.
Validation: Test read/write operations in the chosen storage format to ensure data integrity.
Implement functions to save state:

Task: Write functions to serialize the list of monitored tickers and save to storage.
Validation: Ensure data is correctly saved and can be verified by inspecting the storage file.
Implement functions to load state:

Task: Write functions to deserialize the stored data and load it into the bot.
Validation: Verify that data loads correctly by checking the bot’s state after loading.
7. Scheduling and Automation
Sub-problems and Validation:
Choose a scheduling library (e.g., schedule):

Task: Install and set up a scheduling library.
Validation: Write and test a basic scheduled task to confirm the scheduler’s functionality.
Implement periodic tasks for monitoring and trading:

Task: Write functions to monitor comments and execute trades, and schedule these functions to run at regular intervals.
Validation: Ensure scheduled tasks run as expected by logging their execution.
Ensure continuous operation:

Task: Implement a loop to keep the bot running indefinitely, handling interruptions and resuming operations.
Validation: Test the bot’s resilience by simulating interruptions and verifying recovery.
8. Error Handling and Logging
Sub-problems and Validation:
Implement error handling in API interactions:

Task: Use try-except blocks to catch and manage errors from Reddit and Alpaca APIs.
Validation: Simulate API errors to verify that error handling works as intended.
Implement logging for monitoring activities:

Task: Install and set up a logging library, and write log messages for key events, errors, and state changes.
Validation: Review logs to ensure all critical activities and errors are logged correctly.
Ensure logs are stored and accessible:

Task: Configure log storage (e.g., file system or cloud storage) and implement log rotation and archiving if necessary.
Validation: Check log files to ensure they are being written and archived as expected.
9. Testing and Deployment
Sub-problems and Validation:
Conduct unit testing for individual components:

Task: Write unit tests for data collection, sentiment analysis, trade execution, and ticker management functions.
Validation: Run unit tests to ensure each component behaves correctly in isolation.
Test the bot in a paper trading environment:

Task: Use Alpaca’s paper trading mode to simulate real trades and verify the bot’s behavior and performance.
Validation: Review trade logs and account balance to ensure trades are executed correctly.
Deploy the bot to a cloud service:

Task: Choose a cloud service provider (e.g., AWS, Heroku) and set up the deployment environment.
Validation: Verify the bot’s operation in the cloud environment by monitoring its activities and performance.
Monitor and maintain the bot in production:

Task: Implement monitoring tools to track bot performance and health, and plan for regular maintenance and updates.
Validation: Regularly review monitoring data and logs to ensure the bot is operating as expected and address any issues promptly.
